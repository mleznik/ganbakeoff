# Notebooks Test-Area

If you're not interested in running the docker image and only want to play around with our code / framework, we provide a notebook in this directory.

Please install the [requirements.txt](https://omi-gitlab.e-technik.uni-ulm.de/aml/ganevaluation/-/blob/dev/Docker/requirements.txt) via pip.

## Periodic Waves

To train the conditional GAN on the periodic waves data set, you can use the **example_sinus.ipynb**.
This notebook provides the necessary code to train a GAN locally.
You can chose with the parameters passed to the train method if you want to log the run to wandb.
